# RETabBinder-modified
An addon to automatically change your TAB key binding to only target enemy players when in PvP zones, and to target all enemies when not.

I just edited this version to change Nameplates distance in some situation.
- In PvE mode, Nameplate are Near.
- In PvP Mode, Nameplate are Far.
